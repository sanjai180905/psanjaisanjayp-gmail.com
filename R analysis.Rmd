## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
ggplot(mobile.data, aes(x = Purchase_price, y = Mobile_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Purchase Price", y = "Mobile Price") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between Purchase Price and Mobile Price")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(mobile.data, aes(x = Purchase_price, y = Mobile_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Purchase Price", y = "Mobile Price") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between Purchase Price and Mobile Price")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
